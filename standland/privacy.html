<p>By using this app, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>We will use your Health Data to count your stand hours and show your progress in this app.</p>

<p>We will not use your Health Data for marketing or advertising purposes. Your Health Data will be accessed locally through the HealthKit and will not be stored or cached by the app. Your Health Data will not be sent to our server. This app cannot read from or write to the Health App Database without your consent.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>The security of your information is important to us, but remember that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<h2>Disclaimers</h2>

<p>We make no guarantees as to the suitability of this app for the user, or for any of its functionality, product price, accuracy, or usefulness, and will not be held responsible in the event that damage is incurred.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to change this app or to stop offering it. This company will not be held responsible if this app is discontinued, changed, or otherwise made unusable and data is damaged or lost as a result, or if the device itself is damaged, or if the device incurred damage due to another app.</p>
