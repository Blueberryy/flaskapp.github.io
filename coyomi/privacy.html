Your Calendar Data will be accessed locally through the EventKit and will not be stored or cached by the app.
Your Calendar Data will not be sent to our server.
This app cannot read from or write without your consent.</p>

<p>The calendar service (such as iCloud or Google) may send your Calendar Data to the server.
Please refer to the privacy policy of your service and use it at your discretion.</p>

<h2>2. Security</h2>

<p>We will not change this agreement to allow the collection of your personal information or make other significant changes without your consent.</p>

<h2>4. Disclaimers</h2>

<p>We reserve the right to change this app or to stop offering it.
This company will not be held responsible if this app is discontinued, changed, or otherwise made unusable and data is damaged or lost as a result, or if the device itself is damaged, or if the device incurred damage due to another app.</p>
