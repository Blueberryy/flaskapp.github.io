<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Last updated: August 10, 2017</p>

<p>Flask LLP ("us", "we", or "our") operates the Zones iOS application ("this app").</p>

<p>By using this app, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>


<h2>1. Information Collection And Use</h2>

<h3>1-1. Health Data</h3>

<p>We will use the Apple HealthKit APIs to read and/or write certain data to the Health App Database on your device (the “Health Data”).<br>
Such information may include, for example:

  <!-- Health Data -->
	<ul>
		<li>Workouts</li>
		<li>Heart Rate</li>
		<li>Distance</li>
		<li>Active Energy</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<!-- Purpose -->
<p>We will use your Health Data to show you the workout details and the heart rate zones.</p>

<p>
We will not use Health Data for marketing or advertising purposes.
Health Data will be accessed locally through Apple HealthKit and will not be stored or cached by the app.
This app cannot read from or write to the Health Database without your consent.
Health Data will not be sent to our server.</p>

<h3>1-2. Location Data</h3>
<p>This app will start to collect location data from sources such as GPS, Wi-Fi and cell towers once you install the App and consent to the App’s tracking your location (the “Location Data”). </p>

<p>We will use your Location Data to show you the route map of your workout.</p>

<p>We will not use Location Data for marketing or advertising purposes.
Location Data is stored locally and not sent to our server.
This app cannot read your location without your consent.
You can adjust your mobile device settings by following the instructions <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203033">here</a>.</p>


<h3>1-3. Crash Log</h3>
<p>This app uses <a href="https://fabric.io/kits/ios/crashlytics">Crashlytics</a>, a crash reporting system which allows us to become quickly aware of any problems by sending anonymous crash reports. If this app crashes during normal use,
information about the crash (such as the time of the crash, the device model, iOS version, and the state of the application at the time of the crash) will be sent to the servers of Crashlytics.<br />
The privacy policy of Crashlytics is available at <a href="http://try.crashlytics.com/terms/">Crashlytics web site</a>.</p>


<h2>2. Security</h2>

<p>The security of your information is important to us, but remember that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>


<h2>3. Changes To This Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

<p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>

<p>We will not change this agreement to allow the collection of your PHR Data or make other significant changes without your consent.</p>

<h2>4. Disclaimers</h2>

<p>We make no guarantees as to the suitability of this app for the user, or for any of its functionality, product price, accuracy, or usefulness, and will not be held responsible in the event that damage is incurred.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to change this app or to stop offering it.
This company will not be held responsible if this app is discontinued, changed, or otherwise made unusable and data is damaged or lost as a result, or if the device itself is damaged, or if the device incurred damage due to another app.</p>
