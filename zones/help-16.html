		<h1>Wrong Total Active Calories or Distance</h1>

		<p>
			Total active calorie and total distance of workout measured by Zones are based on values registered in Apple Health.<br />
			The causes of these incorrect values are as follows<br />
			<ol>
				<li>Apple Watch (watchOS) could not calculate the correct value</li>
				<li>Zones could not collect the correct samples</li>
			</ol>
			Please investigate the cause by the following.
	  </p>

		<h2>Re-collect sample data</h2>
		<p>
			You can recollect from the data registered in Apple Health on the workout editing view.
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Open "Zones" app on iPhone.</li>
			<li>Tap the workout and show workout detail view.</li>
			<li>Tap the pencil icon (edit button) on the top right.</li>
			<li>Tap distance or active calorie.</li>
			<li>Select Apple Watch source</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			The app re-collects the sample data from the selected source and show the total value.
		</p>

		<h3>If it changes to the correct value</h3>
		<p>
			Zones could not collect the correct data or registration could be delayed due to some troubles of Apple Health on Apple Watch.<br />
			After restarting Apple Watch and iPhone, try measuring new workout and check whether it is updated properly.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the case of swimming, the range of the distance sample is as long as 1 minute, so it may not contain data for the last minute of workout. Please note.
		</p>

		<h3>If it remains the wrong value</h3>
		<p>
			It is possible that Apple Watch (watchOS) could not calculate the correct value.<br />
			Check the original data (sample) with Apple Health.<br />
		</p>
		<p>
			For active calories, please select the source of Apple Watch and "Update" your workout before trying the following.<br />
			(By updating, samples of active calorie are linked to workout.)
		</p>

		<h4>Show sample data on Apple Health</h4>
		</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Open Apple "Health" on iPhone</li>
				<li>Tap "Health Data" on tab</li>
				<li>Tap "Activity"</li>
				<li>Tap "Workouts"</li>
				<li>Tap "Show All Data"</li>
				<li>Tap the workout</li>
				<li>Tap "Total Active Energy" or "Total *** Deistance" of "WORKOUT SAMPLES"</li>
			</ol>

		<h4>If there are samples with wrong values</h4>
		<p>
			Please check settings to accuracy increases of your Apple Watch.<br />
			<ul>
				<li>Apple Support: <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207941">Get the most accurate measurements using your Apple Watch</a></li>
				<li>Apple Support: <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204516">Calibrating your Apple Watch Series 1 or earlier for improved Workout and Activity accuracy</a></li>
			</ul>
			The already registered sample data will not be updated even if you change the setting.<br />
			Please measure and check the new workout.
		</p>

		<h4>If The number of samples is small or none</h4>
		<p>
			There was a possibility that there was some trouble with Apple Watch.<br />
			If you are going to workout again and still in the same state, please check the following.
			<ul>
				<li>Is it correctly measured by Apple's "workout" application?</li>
				<li>Try restarting Apple Watch and iPhone.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Some activities do not record distance samples.<br />
			Rowing, Stairs, Step Training, etc.
		</p>

		<h4>If samples are recorded in duplicate</h4>
		<p>
			Confirm the setting of the source (app) registering the sample.<br />
			Also note that if you are synchronizing Health data on iCloud, data registered with other devices will also be synchronized.
