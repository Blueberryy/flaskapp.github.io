		<p>Of course, you can also display what you recorded with iPhone's Health App or Apple Watch's Workout App.</p>

		<h3>Heart Rate</h3>
		<p>Heart rate is read from Apple Health.<br />
			Regardless of whether or not there is connected with workout,
			zone time and exercise intensity are judged based on all heart rate recorded in Apple Health.
		</p>
		<p>The heart rate registered from Apple Watch is usually recorded in a few minutes,
			but it will be recorded in detail every few seconds while measuring with a workout compatible application.<br />
			In order to obtain accurate information, we recommend that you measure with a workout compatible application on Apple Watch.
		</p>

		<h3>Distance</h3>
		<p>
			If there are distance datas connected with your workout, it loads it.<br />
			If there is no connected data, split time is not displayed.<br />
			You can check if it is connected with workout in Apple Health application.
		</p>
		<p>
			There is a difference in the content of the distance data by the application.<br />
			<table>
				<tr><td></td><td>Measuring device</td><td>Connection</td><td>Connection at pause</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Zones</td><td>Apple Watch</td><td>yes</td><td>no</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Apple's Workout app</td><td>Apple Watch</td><td>yes</td><td>no</td></tr>
				<tr><td>RunKeeper</td><td>Apple Watch</td><td>yes</td><td>no</td></tr>
				<tr><td>RunKeeper</td><td>iPhone</td><td>no</td><td>no</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Runtastic</td><td>Apple Watch</td><td>no</td><td>no</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Runtastic</td><td>iPhone</td><td>no</td><td>no</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Nike+ Run Club</td><td>Apple Watch</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Strava</td><td>Apple Watch</td><td>yes(summarized)</td><td>-</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Strava</td><td>iPhone</td><td>yes(summarized)</td><td>-</td></tr>
			</table>
			Zones conform to the Apple's workout app.
		</p>

		<h3>Split Time</h3>
		<p>
			If distance datas are connected with your workout, split time is displayed.<br />
			But it is not displayed when the distance is smaller than 1 km(mile).
		</p>
		<p>
			Calculation of pace uses time excluding pause time.<br />
			It uses distance including pause time.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>Nike + Run Club</b><br />
			Split time is incorrect if pose is included, due to different usage of distance data.<br />
			(The display on Zones may be a faster pace than it actually is.)
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>RunKeeper</b><br />
			It seems that the pace of split is calculated by the time including pause time.<br />
			Therefore, there is a possibility that it is different from the value with Zones.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Runtastic</b><br />
			Split time is not displayed because distance data is not connected to Workout.
		<p>
